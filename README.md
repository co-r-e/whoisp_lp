# WhoisP Landing Page

Static landing page for the WhoisP project built with Next.js App Router. The repository is pre-configured for static export, GitHub Pages deployment, and multilingual (English/Japanese) content.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to develop. The site is statically generated, so avoid using server-only features.

## Production Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build command produces a static `out/` directory. The preview command serves that folder locally via `serve` for a production-like check.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Push this repository to GitHub and ensure the default branch is `main` (update the workflow branch filter if you use something else).
2. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository and select the "GitHub Actions" deployment source (Settings â†’ Pages).
3. Every push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` which:
   - Installs dependencies with npm.
   - Builds the static site with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` inferred from the repository owner/name.
   - Uploads the `out/` directory as a Pages artifact and publishes it.
4. After the workflow finishes, the site is available at:
   - `https://<OWNER>.github.io` for a user/organization pages repo named `<OWNER>.github.io`.
   - `https://<OWNER>.github.io/<REPO>` for any other repository.

If you want to override the canonical origin, set the repository secret `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and the workflow will automatically pick it up.

## Google Search Console Registration

1. Wait until the site is live at the GitHub Pages URL.
2. Log in to https://search.google.com/search-console and choose **URL prefix** property type. Enter the exact Pages URL including the repository path (for example, `https://example.github.io/whoisp_lp2`).
3. Pick **HTML file** verification, download the `googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html` file, and move it into the `public/` directory of this project.
4. Commit and push the file to `main`; the next deployment will publish it at `https://<OWNER>.github.io/<REPO>/googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html`.
5. Click **Verify** in Search Console. After success, open the property and submit `https://<OWNER>.github.io/<REPO>/sitemap.xml` via **Sitemaps**.
6. Use **URL Inspection** to request indexing for the homepage (`/`) and the Japanese page (`/ja`). Repeat whenever major content updates occur.

## Built-in SEO Enhancements

- Canonical URLs, language alternates, Open Graph, and Twitter card metadata defined in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Structured data (`SoftwareApplication` and `FAQPage`) injected via JSON-LD.
- Auto-generated `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` exposed through Next.js metadata routes.
- Keyword metadata sourced from `src/content/landing.ts` and synchronized for both locales.
- GitHub Pages-aware `basePath`/`assetPrefix` handling in `next.config.ts`, including automatic detection for user-page repositories.

Keep content updates within `src/content/landing.ts` to ensure metadata, structured data, and copy stay aligned across locales.
